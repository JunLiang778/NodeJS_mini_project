# NodeJS_mini_project

A simple nodeJS blog post website using express, mongodb & template engine (EJS). Users are able to create blogs, view individual blog post and delete them. This project using the MVC architecture to keep my code more modular, reusable & easier to read. Ignore the server.js & notes.txt files, they were there just for my understanding.
## Usage
```
npm install

# Run on http://localhost:3000
nodemon app

```
